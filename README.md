# DestinyOne

A premium, intentional dating and matrimony MVP for Indians in the USA, built with Expo, React Native, and TypeScript.

DestinyOne is exclusively for committed long-term relationships and marriage. Casual and short-term intentions are not part of the product.

## Run

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

Then press `i` for iOS, `a` for Android, or `w` for the web preview.

## Quality checks

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm check
```

The automated suite covers matching/ranking, wallet gift rules, and authentication validation. Core controls include screen-reader roles, labels, selected states, and disabled states. A branded error boundary protects users from a blank screen, while privacy-safe analytics and crash adapters are ready for production providers without collecting contact details, messages, profile IDs, photos, or precise locations.

All profiles use mock data. Session and conversation state are stored locally with AsyncStorage. Backend connection points are intentionally kept behind this state layer; Firebase or Supabase can replace it without changing the visual components.

For local preview without Supabase, the OTP demo accepts `123456` or `12345`. Production builds should explicitly block this fallback with `EXPO_PUBLIC_REQUIRE_REAL_BACKEND=true`.

## Production backend

The app automatically uses Supabase when `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are configured. Local preview can run in demo mode, but production builds should set `EXPO_PUBLIC_REQUIRE_REAL_BACKEND=true` so fake OTP/local-only auth cannot ship.

Start with [.env.example](./.env.example), then apply [the initial migration](./supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql). The schema includes RLS-protected profiles, preferences, matches, messages, gifts, date proposals, vouches, discovery signals, subscriptions, coins, blocks, and reports.

Never include a Supabase service-role key in the mobile app.

## Payments

DestinyOne keeps checkout simple and store-compliant: digital subscriptions and gift coins use official Apple/Google in-app billing, while optional real-world venue holds and physical gifts can use Stripe Apple Pay. The browser and unconfigured builds use clearly labelled no-charge demo orders. See [the payment setup guide](./docs/PAYMENTS.md).

- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` explains the live web launch flow.
- `docs/PLAY_STORE_LAUNCH.md` explains the Android/Google Play launch flow.
- `docs/PLAY_STORE_DATA_SAFETY_DRAFT.md` provides a draft Data Safety worksheet.

Run the complete local release gate with `pnpm release:check`.

## Live web deployment

The recommended production web host is Vercel. Push this project to GitHub, import it into Vercel, and the app will build with `pnpm build:web` and publish from `dist`. Netlify is also supported with `netlify.toml`.

See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](./docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).
